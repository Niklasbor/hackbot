# hackbot
An automated hackbot. Eventually.

It's only an ARP scanner, a port scanner, and a service scanner right now, but it can be great. Just you wait.

The dream:

  Automatic exploit modules

  Self-replication

  Facilitated, secure communication between infected systems

  Learning and adapting
